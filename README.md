Attempt to implement a simple sentiment analysis using twitter.

This project is an attempt to implement some simple sentiment analysis to predict stock market value based off of toe prevelence of keywords on twitter. Specifically, we implement the Kardashian Theory of sentiment analysis. The frequency of tweets about members of the Kardashian and Jenner families may be used as a general proxy for the mood of the public: more Kardashian-centric tweets means the public is more carefree, which means the economy should be doing well.

As a first step, we put this theory to the test and quantify the association between stock value and various measures of the Kardashianness of the twittersphere. Later we intend to implement a (likely very innacurate) regressor for predicting stock prices. 

In case this isn't clear from the get-go, this proposal is a joke. The code however, is serious.
